# Deep-Learning-Tutorials
Some useful links about learning deep learning



1.Book 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow Yoshua Bengio Aaron Courville
  http://www.deeplearningbook.org 
  A very classical textbook. 

2.Deep learning courses at Stanford:
  CS 231 by Andrew Ng. 
  The first part of this course can be found on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
  It consists of five parts: 
      1). Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
      2). Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and  Optimization conducted
      3). Structuring Machine Learning Projects
      4). Convolutional Neural Networks  
      5). Sequence Models

  The Second part of this course can be found on the course' web:
  https://cs230.stanford.edu/lecture/
  
  I really like the style of teaching of Kian Katanforoosh! The ten lectures focus most on the practical application of deep learning and introduce GANs.
  
   I make some notes about the whole class, you can see them here: 
   
   Also, I find some great notes and codes :

5. Chris Albon: https://chrisalbon.com 
   This is a very comprehensive notes on data science and artificial intelligence. When you start to code, you always need to     do some data preprocessing, feature engineering and choose an appropriate method of model evaluations. This web provides complete codes with clear explanation step by step.
