CS 231 by Andrew Ng. A Deep learning course at Stanford 
---
### The video lectures resources:<br>
The first half of this course can be found on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning<br>
It consists of five parts: <br>

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning <br>
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and  Optimization conducted<br>
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects<br>
* Convolutional Neural Networks  <br>
* Sequence Models<br>
<br>
The rest of this course can be found on the its web: https://cs230.stanford.edu/lecture/ <br>
I really like the style of teaching of Kian Katanforoosh! The ten lectures focus most on the practical application of deep learning and introduce GANs.<br>
  
### The notes, quize solutions and codes resources:
* I make some notes about the whole class, you can see them here: https://github.com/qin67/Deep-Learning-Tutorials/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Notes%20by%20Hongqian%20Qin.pdf <br>
   
* Also, I find some great notes and codes :<br>

## Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders v3 , by jeremy howard:
 https://course.fast.ai<br>
 * CS231 uses TensorFlow but fast.ai v3 uses PyTorch. 
 * Fastai is a library like keras.Jeremy teaches by looking practical examples first, he focuses more on how to master coding skills to apply deep learning in real data. Andrew explains the math behind each formula and code. 
 * If you do not believe you are patient enough or your math is not so good, I suggest you to watch fast.ai v3 first. But currently, you can still find much more open resources on keras than on fastai, so if you want to deep dive in deep learning area, I strongly suggest you to study both courses.
 * I have watched fast.ai v3 part 1, and it is awesome! But my friend who has watched both v2 and v3 told me that the v2 is even better than v3. For those who are interested in fast.ai v2, here is the link: https://course18.fast.ai/index.html<br>
For those beginner in machine learning, Jeremy has another course *Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders:http://course18.fast.ai/ml<br>

It combines very comprehensive notes on data science and artificial intelligence. When you start a deep learning project, you always need to do some data preprocessing, feature engineering and choose an appropriate method of model evaluations. This web provides complete codes with clear explanations step by step. <br>
